### Remote MCP Server Integration Architecture

**Authentication & User Management:**

1. Users register for meal tracker in Second Brain web app
2. System generates unique API key for each user to access remote MCP server
3. Users configure Claude Desktop with their personal API key and remote MCP server URL
4. MCP server validates API key and identifies user for all operations
5. API keys can be regenerated/revoked through web interface

**AI-Powered Entry Flow:**

1. User describes meal via Claude Desktop ("Had 2 scrambled eggs and toast for breakfast")
2. Claude Desktop sends request to remote MCP server with user's API key
3. MCP server authenticates request and identifies user
4. Server processes natural language and estimates nutrition data
5. Server creates food entry using existing `add_entry` tool with user context
6. Entry is immediately available in Second Brain web interface
7. User can view, edit, or delete AI-generated entries through web UI

**Security & Access Control:**

- Each user has individual API key for MCP server access
- User-scoped database access prevents cross-user data leakage
- Rate limiting per API key to prevent abuse
- API key rotation and revocation capabilities
- Audit logging for all MCP server operations

**Bidirectional Sync:**

- Remote MCP server writes to shared D1 database with proper user scoping
- Second Brain API reads/writes to same database tables
- Real-time updates visible across both interfaces
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- Entry metadata tracks creation source (AI vs manual) and API key used
