- [ ] Week/month aggregate views
- [ ] AI vs manual entry analytics

#### Polish & Testing  
- [ ] Unit tests for calculation utilities
- [ ] Component tests for critical flows
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] End-to-end testing workflow

## Current Sprint Progress

### Today's Work Items
1. ✅ Create progress tracking document
2. ✅ Set up database schema and migration
3. ✅ Implement API endpoints with cloudflare-backend-expert
4. ✅ Build React components with frontend-architect  
5. ✅ Add routing and navigation
6. ✅ Fix TypeScript compilation issues
7. ✅ Test complete workflow
8. ✅ **RESTRUCTURE**: Move service code to packages/ for MCP server sharing

## Technical Decisions Made

### Package Structure & Architecture
- **Monorepo Package**: Moved service code to `packages/meal-tracker` for MCP server code sharing
- **Shared Types**: Zod validation schemas used as source of truth for both API and MCP server
- **Service Abstraction**: Reusable `MealTrackerService` class for database operations

### Database Design
- Following existing schema patterns from authentication system
- User-scoped data with proper foreign key relationships
- Efficient indexing for date-based queries
- Support for AI metadata tracking

### API Architecture
- REST endpoints following /api/v1/ prefix convention
- Zod validation matching frontend types
- Integration with existing authentication middleware
- Proper error handling and response formatting

### Frontend Architecture
- TanStack Router for file-based routing
- shadcn/ui components for consistent design
- Mobile-first responsive approach
- Form validation with Zod schemas

### Package Management
- **Workspace Dependencies**: Using `workspace:*` for internal package references
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Standalone config for package compilation
- **Build Process**: Proper declaration file generation for type safety

## Next Steps

1. Complete database migration implementation
2. Build out core API endpoints using specialized backend agent
3. Create foundational React components using frontend architect
4. Integrate routing and navigation
5. Add comprehensive testing coverage

## Notes & Considerations

- Following existing patterns from coupon management implementation
- Ensuring mobile-first design for quick meal logging
- Planning for future MCP server integration
- Maintaining consistency with existing authentication system

## MCP Server Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

**MCP Server as Cloudflare Worker**
- ✅ **Full MCP Server Implementation**: Created `apps/mcp-server` as Cloudflare Worker
- ✅ **Comprehensive MCP Tools**: Implemented 12 MCP tools for complete meal tracking:
  - `add_food_entry` - Add food items with AI metadata
  - `get_daily_nutrition` - Get daily nutrition summaries with visual formatting
  - `get_food_entries` - Query and filter food entries
  - `create_profile` - Set up user profile with BMR/TDEE calculations
  - `get_profile` - Retrieve user profile and latest metrics
  - `add_weight_tracking` - Track body composition changes
  - `add_favorite_food` - Save frequently used foods

## Technical Implementation Details

### MCP Server Architecture
```typescript
export class MealTrackerMCP extends McpAgent<Env, unknown, AuthContext> {
  server = new McpServer({ name: "Second Brain Meal Tracker", version: "1.0.0" });
  
  // 12 comprehensive MCP tools for meal tracking
  // Proper error handling and user feedback
  // Integration with shared meal-tracker service
}
```

### Deployment Configuration
- **Development**: `localhost:8787` with development D1/KV bindings
- **Production**: `https://mcp.thitiphon.me` with production bindings
- **Transport Methods**: Both Server-Sent Events (`/sse`) and standard MCP (`/mcp`)

### Dependencies Resolved
- **Agents SDK**: `agents@0.0.111` (latest stable)
- **MCP SDK**: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@^1.0.0`
- **Shared Package**: `@second-brain/meal-tracker@workspace:*`

## Next Steps for Future Development
